### What are asynchronous thunks?

Asynchronous thunks are functions that return a function, which performs asynchronous operations. This allows you to delay the execution of a function, making it useful in scenarios such as API calls or working with promises.

Example:

```javascript
const fetchData = (url) => (dispatch) => {
  fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => dispatch(data));
};
```
