### What are different event loops?

JavaScript typically uses a single event loop to manage all asynchronous tasks. However, in the context of multiple threads or environments, you might have different event loops, such as in Web Workers, which have their own event loops.

- **Main Event Loop**: Handles tasks in the main thread.
- **Web Worker Event Loop**: Handles tasks in background threads.
