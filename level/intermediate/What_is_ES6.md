### What is ES6?

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is the sixth version of the ECMAScript standard, which defines the scripting language that JavaScript is based on. ES6 introduced many new features, such as `let`, `const`, arrow functions, promises, and modules, making JavaScript more powerful and easier to work with.
