### What is a void operator?

The `void` operator is used to evaluate an expression and return `undefined`. It is often used in situations where you want to execute a function or expression but do not care about its result.

Example:

```javascript
void(0);  // Returns undefined
void(console.log('Hello'));  // Logs 'Hello' and returns undefined
```
