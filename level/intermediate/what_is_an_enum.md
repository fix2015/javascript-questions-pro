### What is an enum?

An `enum` (short for 'enumeration') is a feature in programming languages like TypeScript, which allows you to define a set of named constants. Enums help in making code more readable and maintainable by giving meaningful names to values.

Example in TypeScript:

```typescript
enum Color {
  Red = 'RED',
  Green = 'GREEN',
  Blue = 'BLUE'
}
let color: Color = Color.Red;
console.log(color); // 'RED'
```
