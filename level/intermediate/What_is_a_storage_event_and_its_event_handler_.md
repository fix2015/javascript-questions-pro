### What is a storage event and its event handler?

A storage event is triggered when a change is made to the `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` in the browser, such as adding, removing, or modifying a key-value pair. The event handler for this event allows you to respond to these changes, providing a way to synchronize or react to storage updates across different windows or tabs.
