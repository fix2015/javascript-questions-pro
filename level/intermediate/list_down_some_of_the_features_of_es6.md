### List down some of the features of ES6

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several new features to JavaScript, including:
- **Let and const**: Block-scoped variables.
- **Arrow functions**: Shorter function syntax.
- **Template literals**: String interpolation.
- **Destructuring assignment**: Easier extraction of values from arrays or objects.
- **Promises**: Handling asynchronous operations more efficiently.

Example:

```javascript
const [first, second] = [1, 2];
console.log(first, second);  // Output: 1 2
```
