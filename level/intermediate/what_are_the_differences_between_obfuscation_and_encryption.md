### What are the differences between Obfuscation and Encryption?

Obfuscation and encryption both aim to protect data, but they serve different purposes:
- **Obfuscation**: The goal is to make the code or data difficult to understand for humans but does not prevent someone from reversing it with enough time or effort. It's used primarily for source code protection.
- **Encryption**: The goal is to transform data into a format that cannot be easily read or accessed without the proper decryption key. Encryption is more secure than obfuscation and is often used for securing sensitive information.

Example:
- Obfuscation might involve renaming variables in a script.
- Encryption involves transforming data into a coded format using an encryption algorithm.
