### What is destructuring assignment?

Destructuring assignment is a convenient way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables. It can be used with arrays, objects, and even nested structures.

Example with array:

```javascript
let [x, y] = [1, 2];
console.log(x, y);  // Output: 1 2
```
Example with object:

```javascript
let { name, age } = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
console.log(name, age);  // Output: John 30
```
