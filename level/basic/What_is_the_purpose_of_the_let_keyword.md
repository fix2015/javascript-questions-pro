### What is the purpose of the let keyword?

The `let` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare block-scoped variables. Unlike `var`, which declares variables globally or within a function scope, `let` restricts the variable's scope to the block, statement, or expression in which it is used. This makes `let` more predictable and avoids issues with variable hoisting.
