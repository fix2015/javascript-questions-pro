### How do you locate elements in Protractor?

In Protractor, you can locate elements using various locators such as CSS selectors, XPath, and Angular-specific locators.
- `by.id()`: Locate by ID.
- `by.css()`: Locate by CSS selectors.
- `by.xpath()`: Locate by XPath.

Example:

```javascript
let button = element(by.css('.submit-button'));
```
