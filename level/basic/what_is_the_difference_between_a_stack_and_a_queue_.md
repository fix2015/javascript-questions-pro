### What is the difference between a Stack and a Queue?

A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end (top), whereas in a queue, elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
