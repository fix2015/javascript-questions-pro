### What is an anonymous function?

An anonymous function is a function that is declared without a name. It is often used as a callback or in situations where the function does not need to be referenced elsewhere.

Example:

```javascript
const greet = function() { console.log('Hello'); };
greet(); // 'Hello'
```
