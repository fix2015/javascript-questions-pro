### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types and modern features to the language. It allows you to write code with type annotations, which helps with early error detection, better tooling, and improved code maintainability. TypeScript code is transpiled to regular JavaScript.

Example:

```typescript
let num: number = 10;
let str: string = 'Hello';
```
