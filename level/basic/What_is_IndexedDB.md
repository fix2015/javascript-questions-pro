### What is IndexedDB?

IndexedDB is a low-level API for storing large amounts of structured data, including files and blobs. It allows developers to perform advanced queries and store data persistently in a user's browser. This API is particularly useful for web applications that need to work offline or require local storage beyond simple key-value pairs.
