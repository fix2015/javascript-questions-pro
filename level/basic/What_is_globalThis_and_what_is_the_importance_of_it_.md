### What is `globalThis`, and what is the importance of it?

`globalThis` provides a standard way to access the global object across different environments (browser, Node.js, etc.).

#### Key Points:
1. **Universal Access:**
   - Replaces environment-specific global objects like `window`, `global`, or `self`.

2. **Example:**
   ```javascript
   console.log(globalThis); // In browsers, equivalent to window.
   ```
