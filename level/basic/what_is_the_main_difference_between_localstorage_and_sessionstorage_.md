### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?

The main difference is the lifespan of the stored data:
- **`localStorage`** persists data even after the browser is closed, and the data remains available until explicitly removed.
- **`sessionStorage`** only stores data for the duration of the page session. Once the tab or window is closed, the data is cleared.
