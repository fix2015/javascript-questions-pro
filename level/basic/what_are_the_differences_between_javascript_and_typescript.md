### What are the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript?

The key differences between JavaScript and TypeScript include:
- **TypeScript** has optional static typing, while **JavaScript** is dynamically typed.
- **TypeScript** supports modern JavaScript features and compiles down to JavaScript, while **JavaScript** is interpreted directly by the browser or Node.js.
- **TypeScript** provides better tooling and editor support with features like type inference, autocompletion, and error checking during development.

Example:

```typescript
let age: number = 30; // TypeScript
let name = 'John'; // JavaScript
```
