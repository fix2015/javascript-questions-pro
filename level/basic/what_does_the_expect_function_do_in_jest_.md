### What does the expect function do in Jest?

The `expect` function is used to create an assertion. It takes a value and returns an object that allows you to make assertions on that value, such as checking if it equals another value or if it meets certain conditions.

Example:

```javascript
expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
```
