### What are the different ways to deal with Asynchronous Code?

JavaScript offers several ways to handle asynchronous code, including callbacks, promises, and async/await.

- **Callbacks**: A function passed as an argument to be executed later.
- **Promises**: A value that represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
- **Async/Await**: A modern syntax for handling promises in a synchronous-like manner.

Example using `async/await`:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  let data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
fetchData();
```
