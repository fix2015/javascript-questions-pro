### What is Babel?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to write next-generation JavaScript code (ES6/ES7+) and transform it into code that can run on older browsers or environments. Babel can also be used to compile JSX for React applications.

Example of a Babel transformation:

```javascript
let greet = () => console.log('Hello');  // ES6 arrow function
```
