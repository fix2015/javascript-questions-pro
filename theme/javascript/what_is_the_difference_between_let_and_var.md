### What is the difference between let and var?

The primary differences between `let` and `var` are their scoping rules and hoisting behavior:

1. **Scope**: `let` is block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped.
2. **Hoisting**: Both `let` and `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope, but `let` is not initialized until the code execution reaches it, leading to a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

**Tags**: [basic](./level/basic), [let](./theme/let), [var](./theme/var), [JavaScript](./theme/javascript)
