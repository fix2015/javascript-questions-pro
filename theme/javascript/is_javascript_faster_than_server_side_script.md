### Is JavaScript faster than server-side script?

JavaScript runs in the browser and is typically faster for client-side operations, especially for DOM manipulation and interactions. However, server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Node.js) can be faster for processing large datasets or performing complex operations due to server-side resources.
