### What is Deno?

Deno is a modern, secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, built on V8 and written in Rust. It was created by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js, to address some of Node.js's design limitations.

Features:
- Secure by default (no file, network, or environment access without explicit permission).
- Supports TypeScript out of the box.
- Uses ES modules instead of CommonJS.

Example:

```javascript
// Example Deno script
console.log('Hello, Deno!');
```
