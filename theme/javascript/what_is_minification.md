### What is Minification?

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from JavaScript code, such as whitespace, comments, and newline characters, without affecting the functionality of the code. This is done to reduce the file size and improve the performance of web applications by decreasing load times.

Example:

```javascript
// Original Code
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Minified Code
function sum(a,b){return a+b;}
```
