### How do you write multi-line strings in template literals?

You can create multi-line strings in template literals by simply including line breaks within the backticks. This is much easier than using traditional string concatenation.

Example:

```javascript
let multilineString = `This is a
multi-line
string.`;
console.log(multilineString);
// Output: 
// This is a
// multi-line
// string.
```
