### What are the differences between Promises and Observables?

Promises and Observables are both used for handling asynchronous operations, but they have key differences:

- **Promises**: Represent a single value that will be resolved or rejected in the future.
- **Observables**: Represent a stream of values that can emit multiple values over time.

Example of Promise:

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { resolve('Resolved'); });
```
