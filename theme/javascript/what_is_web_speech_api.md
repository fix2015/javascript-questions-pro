### What is Web Speech API?

The Web Speech API provides the ability to recognize and synthesize speech in web applications. It consists of two parts: the Speech Recognition API and the Speech Synthesis API.

- **Speech Recognition API**: Allows the recognition of speech and converts it into text.
- **Speech Synthesis API**: Allows the synthesis of speech from text.

Example of Speech Synthesis:

```javascript
let utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello, World!');
speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
```
