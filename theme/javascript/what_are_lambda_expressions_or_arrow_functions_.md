### What are lambda expressions or arrow functions?

Lambda expressions, also known as arrow functions, are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They use the `=>` syntax and do not have their own `this` value, meaning they inherit `this` from the surrounding context. They are often used for short, anonymous functions in callbacks or array methods.
