### Why do you need Obfuscation?

Obfuscation is used to protect JavaScript code from being easily read, understood, or modified by unauthorized parties. This is particularly important in scenarios where the source code is exposed in the client-side, such as in web applications. By obfuscating the code, developers can help prevent reverse engineering and intellectual property theft.

Example uses of obfuscation:
- Protecting proprietary algorithms
- Hiding sensitive information like API keys (though not recommended as a primary security measure)
- Preventing unauthorized modifications
