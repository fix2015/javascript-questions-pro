### What are regular expression patterns?

Regular expression patterns are sequences of characters that form search patterns. They are used to match strings based on specific rules. Patterns can include literals, special characters, and character classes.

Example:

```javascript
const regex = /\d+/; // Matches one or more digits
console.log('123abc'.match(regex)); // ['123']
```
