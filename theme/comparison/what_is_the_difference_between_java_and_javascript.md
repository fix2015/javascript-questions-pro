### What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?

Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages with different use cases:

- **Java**: A statically typed, object-oriented language mainly used for backend development, mobile apps (Android), and enterprise-level applications.
- **JavaScript**: A dynamically typed, interpreted language used for frontend development to create interactive web pages and dynamic content.

Despite the similar names, they are unrelated in terms of syntax and functionality.
