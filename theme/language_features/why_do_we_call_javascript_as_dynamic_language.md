### Why do we call JavaScript a dynamic language?

JavaScript is considered a dynamic language because it supports dynamic typing, meaning that variables do not have a fixed type. You can assign any type of value to a variable at runtime, and it can change its type during execution.

Example:

```javascript
let dynamicVar = 10;  // Number
dynamicVar = 'Hello';  // String
```
