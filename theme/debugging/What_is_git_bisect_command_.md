### What is git bisect command?

The `git bisect` command is used to find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search. You start by marking a known good commit and a known bad commit. Git then checks out the midpoint commit, and you test it. Based on the result, Git narrows down the range of commits until the problematic one is found.
