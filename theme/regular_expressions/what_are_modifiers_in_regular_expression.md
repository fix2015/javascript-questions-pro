### What are modifiers in regular expression?

Modifiers are flags that alter the behavior of regular expressions. Common modifiers include:

- `g` (global): Matches all occurrences.
- `i` (ignore case): Ignores case when matching.
- `m` (multiline): Treats beginning and end characters (^ and $) as working across multiple lines.
