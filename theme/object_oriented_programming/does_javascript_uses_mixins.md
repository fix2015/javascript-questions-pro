### Does JavaScript use mixins?

Yes, JavaScript can implement mixins, which are objects that provide methods to other objects. A mixin is a way to reuse functionality across different objects without using inheritance.

Example:

```javascript
let mixin = {
  greet() { console.log('Hello!'); }
};

let obj = Object.assign({}, mixin);
obj.greet();  // Output: 'Hello!'
```
