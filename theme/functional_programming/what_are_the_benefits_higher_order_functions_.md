### What are the benefits of higher-order functions?

1. **Code Reusability:**
   - Allows reusing logic by passing different functions.

2. **Readability and Maintainability:**
   - Makes code more declarative and easier to understand.

3. **Functional Programming Support:**
   - Encourages immutability and pure functions.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - Hides low-level details and focuses on high-level operations.

Example:
```javascript
function applyOperation(arr, operation) {
  return arr.map(operation);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const squared = applyOperation(numbers, num => num * num);
console.log(squared); // [1, 4, 9]
```
