### What are tasks in event loop?

In JavaScript, tasks (also called 'macrotasks') refer to operations in the event loop that are executed one by one. Each task is a block of code that is executed synchronously, like handling events, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, etc.

Tasks are processed in the event loop, and when one task completes, the next one in the queue is executed.
