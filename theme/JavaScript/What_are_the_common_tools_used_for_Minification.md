- **UglifyJS**: A popular JavaScript minifier that can be used via the command line or as a library.
- **Terser**: A JavaScript minifier that is a fork of UglifyJS, focused on modern JavaScript features.
- **Google Closure Compiler**: A JavaScript optimizer that can minify and optimize JavaScript code.
