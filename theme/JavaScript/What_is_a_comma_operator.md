### What is a comma operator?

The comma operator in JavaScript allows you to evaluate multiple expressions in a single statement, returning the value of the last expression. It is useful when you need to execute several operations within a single statement.

Example:

```javascript
let a = (1, 2, 3);
console.log(a); // 3
```
