### What is the purpose of `some` method in arrays?

The `some` method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the provided test function. It returns `true` if any element meets the condition, otherwise `false`.

Example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let hasEven = numbers.some(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(hasEven);  // Output: true
```
