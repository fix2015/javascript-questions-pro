### What is the difference between internal and external JavaScript?

Internal JavaScript is written directly inside the `<script>` tag within an HTML document, while external JavaScript is placed in a separate `.js` file that is linked to the HTML using the `src` attribute.

Example of internal JavaScript:

```html
<script>
  console.log('Internal JS');
</script>
```
Example of external JavaScript:

```html
<script src='script.js'></script>
```
