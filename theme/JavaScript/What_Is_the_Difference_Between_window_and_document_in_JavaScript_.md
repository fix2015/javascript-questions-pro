### What Is the Difference Between `window` and `document` in JavaScript?

`window` represents the browser window and is the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment. `document`, on the other hand, represents the HTML document loaded in the browser, allowing interaction with the DOM.

```javascript
console.log(window); // Browser window
console.log(document); // HTML document
```
