### What Are the Main Rules of Promise in JavaScript?

The main rules of Promises in JavaScript are:
1. A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
2. A promise can only transition from pending to fulfilled or rejected, and cannot change back.
3. You can attach `.then()` to handle success and `.catch()` for errors.
