### How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers?

In modern browsers, you can simulate a zero timeout by using `setTimeout` with a delay of `0`. However, it will be subject to the browser's throttling mechanism, especially in inactive tabs.

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('Executed after zero delay'), 0);
```
