### What are Jest assertion methods?

Jest provides a variety of assertion methods, such as `toBe()`, `toEqual()`, `toContain()`, `toHaveBeenCalled()`, and more. These methods are used to check if values meet certain conditions.

Example:

```javascript
expect(10).toBe(10);
expect([1, 2, 3]).toContain(2);
```
