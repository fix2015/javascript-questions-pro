### How do you handle forms in Protractor?

In Protractor, forms can be handled by interacting with form fields (input, select, etc.), filling them out, and submitting the form.

Example:

```javascript
let nameField = element(by.id('name'));
nameField.sendKeys('John Doe');
let submitButton = element(by.id('submit'));
submitButton.click();
```
