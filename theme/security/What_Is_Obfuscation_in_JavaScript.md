### What Is Obfuscation in JavaScript?

Obfuscation in JavaScript refers to the process of making code difficult to understand or read by humans. This is typically done to protect the code from reverse engineering or tampering. It involves techniques like renaming variables and functions to meaningless names, removing whitespace, and making the code less readable.

Example:

```javascript
// Original Code
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }

// Obfuscated Code
var _0x1234 = function(_0x5678, _0x9abc) { return _0x5678 + _0x9abc; };
```
