### What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?

1. **`setTimeout`**:
   - Executes code after a minimum delay.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);
     ```

2. **`setImmediate`**:
   - Executes code after the current event loop cycle.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'));
     ```

3. **`process.nextTick`**:
   - Executes code before the next event loop iteration.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     process.nextTick(() => console.log('Next Tick'));
     ```
