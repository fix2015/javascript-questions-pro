### What are the two types of loops in JavaScript?

There are two main types of loops in JavaScript:

1. **For loop** – Repeats a block of code a certain number of times.
2. **While loop** – Repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true.

Example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

let j = 0;
while (j < 5) {
  console.log(j);
  j++;
}
```
