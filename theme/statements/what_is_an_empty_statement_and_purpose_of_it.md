### What is an empty statement and purpose of it?

An empty statement in JavaScript is a statement that does nothing. It is represented by a semicolon (`;`) on its own. Although it does not perform any action, it can be used in loops, conditionals, or in places where a statement is syntactically required.

Example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ; }
// No operation happens in the loop, but the loop is still valid
```
