### Arrow func?

Arrow functions in JavaScript are a shorter syntax for writing functions. They are defined using `=>` and do not have their own `this` value, which means they inherit `this` from the surrounding context. This makes them useful in situations like event handling and callbacks where `this` behavior can be tricky.
