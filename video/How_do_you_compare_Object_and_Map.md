### How do you compare Object and Map?

Both `Object` and `Map` are key-value stores in JavaScript, but they have differences:

1. **Key Types**: `Map` can use any data type as a key, while `Object` keys are always converted to strings.
2. **Iteration**: `Map` preserves the order of insertion, while `Object` does not guarantee order.
3. **Performance**: `Map` is generally more efficient for frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs.
