### What Is Strict Mode in JavaScript?

Strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted version of JavaScript. It helps catch common coding mistakes and prevents the use of certain features that can lead to bugs, such as using undeclared variables.

```javascript
'use strict';
var x = 3.14; // Error in strict mode: assignment to undeclared variable
```
