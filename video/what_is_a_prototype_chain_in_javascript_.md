### What is a Prototype Chain in JavaScript?

The prototype chain is a fundamental concept in JavaScript's inheritance model. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is another object. When you access a property of an object, JavaScript will first look for it in the object itself. If not found, it will look in the object's prototype, and then the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it reaches `null`.
